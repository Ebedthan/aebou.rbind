# Biography

From my studies i'm a crop protection engineer. I have done my master thesis in the field of bioinformatics at [the Institute of Ecology and Evolution of University of Bern](http://www.iee.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) under the supervision of [Dominique Koua](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominique-koua-4397a313/), the first PhD in the field of bioinformatics in [Ivory Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast) and [Lucia Kuhn-Nentwig](http://www.ecol.iee.unibe.ch/about_us/staff/dr_kuhn_nentwig_lucia/index_eng.html), the principal scientific that works on [*Cupiennius salei*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupiennius_salei).  

My thesis was "Prediction, functionnal annotation and classification of toxins-like peptides: case of the venom gland of *Macroctenus kingsleyi*".  

I have launched [**@AbidjanRusers**](https://twitter.com/AbidjanRusers) in 2016.
